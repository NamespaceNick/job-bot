# jobs.py
Keeps track of job postings and sends notifications when new ones come out<br />
<br />
I got tired of manually checking job postings, and I wanted to get more
experience with python modules like `requests`, `bs4` and `logging`

## Functionality
- [ ] Aggregate job postings in Google Sheet
- [ ] Send Discord notifications for new job postings
- [ ] Send Discord notifications upon errors
- [ ] Include link to job posting in spreadsheet
